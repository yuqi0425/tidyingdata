# Getting and cleaning data course project files

## CodeBook.md

This is a code book that describes the variables, the data, and the data transformations work I performed to clean up the orginal data set given in the project description. 

## run_analysis.R 

This is the R script of the codes used to achieve the following data transformation, it includes clarifications of what is achieved with each new line of code. 

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## tidy.txt

This is the tidy data set generated from the transformations of the original data set performed in run_analysis.R. 

## README.md 

This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
